            <div class = 'Content'>In High School, I met a friend that lived in a NYCHA neighborhood. I always envied the rent of those places, but I also knew that the management of those neighborhoods were non-existent. Elevators smelled like piss and garbage, the outside courtyards were infested with mosquitoes, and the neighborhood always seemed to have something against someone. Fast forward to the present day, I am now living in close proximity to a NYCHA neighborhood. In fact, I can gaze out my window and see the cement block apartment buildings. This got me wondering: is the neighborhood really as bad as it seems?
